        <h2> Wow, the response to Round 2 exceeded expectations—fantastic job everyone!
          We are truly blown away.</h2>

       <p> This is going to be a big update, so hang tight.</p>

       <p> First, we are launching the next round in our fight against the coronavirus pandemic:
         In Round 3, we are launching three new puzzles:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>   • Nanoluciferase: the model protein</li>
         <li>• Designed antigen: the receptor binding domain of the spike protein* </li>
         <li>  • Full spike protein: the first vaccine candidate**</li>
        </ul>

       <p>  *Special thanks to Prof. Possu Huang and Andres Sperberg in Stanford’s Department of
          Bioengineering for sharing with Eterna this sequence. This is part of their ongoing efforts
          to computationally stabilize SARS-CoV-2 proteins to improve COVID-19 vaccine efficacy.</p>

         <p>  **A version of the full spike protein is the first candidate mRNA vaccine to advance to human
          trials from Moderna, an mRNA therapeutics company, in collaboration with the NIH. We will be
          coding for a variation of the spike protein that has been known to form the proper shape for
          host cell infection.</p>

         <p> We have chosen to grow the mRNA molecules drastically in biological significance and complexity.
          This means the puzzles may be a tad bit more challenging, but it also means one or more
          submissions may be that key molecule that unlocks the mRNA vaccine against the coronavirus.
          If we as a community can come together and achieve this milestone, we will change the face
          of medicine forever. Not only will we significantly impact the coronavirus pandemic, but we
          will forever redefine how medicines are designed and made.</p>

       <p> Please note that the nanoluciferase and designed antigens will be high-throughput experiments
          (similar to Round 2), and thus we are accepting many submissions. For the full spike protein,
          we are accepting a total of 100 submissions, and will, by vote, synthesis a select number of
          winning designs. So make those designs count!</p>


      <p>   Second, the Eterna OpenVaccine Team will be hosting a regular community chat, called the
          Eterna Town Hall:
          These meetings will start next Monday (4/13/2020), time TBD. I (Do Soon) will be present
          along with other members of the Eterna Developer and OpenVaccine teams. We are looking
          to answer any questions players might have, share our vision for the project, and seek
          feedback for our mRNA design efforts. We will field questions via Twitter (@eternagame),
          the Eterna Chat client, and Zoom’s chat function as well as any during the video call.
          Expect another update this coming late this week/this weekend with details!</p>


         <p>  Third, updates on the previous two rounds. Like mentioned before—we are blown away.
          Here is where we are on the previous rounds:</p>

         <p>  Lightning Round: DNA encoding the winning designs (by votes) are en route (some have
          already arrived, other arriving later this week) to the laboratory, and experiments will
          start very soon. Results to follow soon after.</p>

          <p> Round 2: We received an overwhelming number of submissions, and even tried to figure
          out a way to cut down the total number of designs for synthesis (thank you to the players
          who came to the rescue last-minute to filter their own designs!), but after some adjustments
          on the experiment-side, we were able to order ALL submissions for testing! This is quite a
          large order (1200 total sequences in the order), and we are piloting a new synthesis
            technology to meet this demand. We’ll keep you posted throughout the experimental process.</p>

        <p>   Phew, that’s it. Hope everyone is staying safe, and see you next Monday at the Eterna Town Hall!</p>
